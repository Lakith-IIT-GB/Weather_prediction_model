Intellihack 44Below Weather Prediction Project
Overview


This project aims to predict rainfall patterns using historical weather data. The implementation leverages various machine learning algorithms to create a rainfall prediction model based on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and atmospheric pressure.

Data Description

The dataset (weather_data.csv) contains daily weather measurements from January 2023 to October 2023, with the following features:

date: Date of observation

avg_temperature: Average temperature of the day
humidity: Humidity level
avg_wind_speed: Average wind speed
rain_or_not: Target variable (Rain/No Rain)
cloud_cover: Cloud cover percentage
pressure: Atmospheric pressure
Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Conversion of categorical target to binary values (Rain = 1, No Rain = 0)
Missing value imputation using mean strategy
Outlier detection and capping for wind speed
Feature engineering including lag features and interaction terms
Data exploration through correlation analysis and distribution visualization
Models Implemented
The project evaluates several machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
Each model is evaluated using accuracy metrics and classification reports. The best performing models were further optimized using GridSearchCV.

Key Features
Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors of rainfall
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
Forecasting rain probability for future dates (21-day forecast)
